Guide to Compile and Deploy ERC721 Contract using Remix and MetaMask
Prerequisites

    MetaMask installed and set up.
    Basic understanding of Ethereum and smart contracts.

Step-by-Step Guide
Step 1: Access Remix IDE

    Open your web browser and go to Remix IDE (remix.ethereum.org).

Step 2: Importing the Backup Zip File

    In the Remix IDE, click on the “File Explorers” icon on the left sidebar.
    Click on the "hamburger" menu button (the triple bar icon) next to the “File Explorers” title, with WORKSPACES to the right of the icon.
    Select “Restore”, then click the “Browse” to upload the provided backup zip file. Click the "import" button corresponding to "OpenZeppelin ERC721 - 1"

Step 3: Extracting the Files

    Once the zip file is uploaded, it should automatically be extracted. Verify that the EduCare.sol ERC721 contract files are correctly extracted and appear in the file explorer.

Step 4: Compiling the Contract

    Click on the “Solidity Compiler” icon on the left sidebar (3rd icon).
    Ensure that the compiler version matches the pragma statement in your Solidity files (NOTE: as long as the compiler is 0.8.{something} it should be fine).
    Click the “Compile” button to compile the contract.

Step 5: Setting Up MetaMask

    Open MetaMask in your browser.
    Ensure you are logged in and have sufficient ETH for deploying the contract.
    Switch to the Sepolia network:
        Click on the network dropdown at the top of the MetaMask extension.
        Select "Sepolia Test Network" or "Sepolia Main Network" depending on your requirement.

Step 6: Injecting Web3 in Remix

    In Remix, click on the “Deploy & Run Transactions” icon on the left sidebar (2nd last icon).
    Under the "Environment" dropdown, select "Injected Provider".
    You should see your MetaMask account address appear. This confirms that MetaMask is connected to Remix.

Step 7a: Deploying the Contract

    Under the “Deploy & Run Transactions” tab, ensure your compiled contract is selected under “Contract”.
    Since the contract constructor does not require parameters, we will leave them out.
    
    If Deploying a New Contract
    Click the “Deploy” button to deploy a new instance of the contract.
    MetaMask will prompt you to confirm the transaction. Review the details and confirm.

    If Loading an Existing Contract
    Copy and past the contract address in the input field next to the "At Address" button just below the "Deploy" button, then click "At Address"

Step 8: Verifying the Deployment

    After the transaction is confirmed, the deployed contract’s address will appear in the "Deployed Contracts" section.
    You can interact with your deployed contract through this interface.
